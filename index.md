## What is EDGQA?

EDGQA is a QA system over knowledge bases based on Entity-Description Graphs (EDGs). Currently EDGQA has been implemented for DBpedia, tested on LC-QuAD 1.0 and QALD-9.

The above figure shows SPARQL (a. and c.) and EDG (b. and d.) on two exemplar natural language questions. The dashed line connects a description to an intermediate entity. The types of nodes and edges of EDG is defined as follows.

By generating such EDGs, questions are represented as a combination of entities and their description, providing a structure for understanding and answering complex questions. More information are detailed in our paper.
